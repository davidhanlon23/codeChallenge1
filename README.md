TODO: Update this
1. Clone Repo
2. Install Node.js if it isn't already from this website https://nodejs.org/en/download/
3. The command `npm` should work if Node has been installed correctly... so now run `npm install` in the repo's root directory
   - This should install the necessary packages to run the testing framework jest.
4. The command `npm test` will run the tests created in the codeChallenge.test.js file and the command
   `npm start` or `npm run start` will run the codeChallenge.js script. (Please ensure you are in the correct file directory)
